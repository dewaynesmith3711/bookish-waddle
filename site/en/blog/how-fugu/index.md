## How Fugu is my browser?

Given all the reasons (and counter-arguments) listed in my article
[Why not everyone's building for the web yet, but why potentially they should](/blog/building-for-the-web/)
for why companies are currently _not_ building for the web, why should you? My hypothesis is that
many developers and executives alike don't realize how capable the modern web has become.
Double-clicking an image file so it opens in an associated PWA, making modifications, saving the
changes back to the file, and then copying the image contents over into another app, or sharing it
to an email client, is a flow that wasn't possible on the web until recently. But APIs developed in
the context of [Project Fugu](/blog/fugu-status/) üê° such as
[File Handling](https://web.dev/file-handling/),
[File System Access](https://web.dev/file-system-access/),
[Async Clipboard](https://web.dev/async-clipboard/), and [Web Share](https://web.dev/web-share/)
have made this flow possible.

With this in mind, I have developed a test application with the tongue-in-cheek name
[How Fugu is my browser?](https://howfuguismybrowser.dev/) that you can take for a spin to see what
Project Fugu APIs your browser of choice supports. Since not all features are exposed on all
platforms, for example, the [Contact Picker API](https://web.dev/contact-picker/) is currently only
exposed on mobile, it's technically impossible to reach a score of 100% if you test on desktop (and
vice versa), so regard it as more like a playful competition than absolute science. For each tested
feature, there's a link to the relevant documentation so you can learn more about the feature. Where
feature detection is possible, there is also a note on whether the feature is supported by your
browser or not, and finally
[page load statistics linked to Chrome Status](https://chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity)
that tell you how popular over time a given feature is.

If your browser supports the Web Share API, you can share how Fugu your browser is by clicking the
**Share** button right next to the Fugu fish and the progress bar.

## How Fugu is the Web?

Knowing how Fugu your browser is is only half of the equation. Equally interesting is knowing how
Fugu the web is. To find an answer to this question, I have developed a browser extension with a
likewise tongue-in-cheek
name‚Äî[How Fugu is the web?](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/how-fugu-is-the-web/apcghpabklkjjgpfoplnglnjghonjhdl).

When you install this extension from the Chrome Web Store and browse the web, you will notice that
the Fugu fish counter on some sites displays a badge with the detected Project Fugu APIs. For
example, if you browse to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), the counter jumps to 9, since
Excalidraw uses nine detectable Project Fugu APIs, namely
[CacheStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage),
[Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API),
[Web Share](https://web.dev/web-share/), [Async Clipboard](https://web.dev/async-clipboard/),
[Async Clipboard (Images)](https://web.dev/async-clipboard/),
[File System Access](https://web.dev/file-system-access/),
[Web Share Target](https://web.dev/web-share-target/),
[Web Share Target (Files)](https://web.dev/web-share-target/), and
[File Handling](https://web.dev/file-handling/). Again, you can see if your browser supports the
feature and click through to documentation by clicking on **Details**, and also directly check out
the relevant source code snippet by clicking on the source code link in the bullet list.

## Conclusions

After browsing the web with the
[How Fugu is the Web?](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/how-fugu-is-the-web/apcghpabklkjjgpfoplnglnjghonjhdl)
extension installed, it is impressive to see how often the Project Fugu API badge appears. This
ranges from pages with comfort features like being able to paste images into an app like, for
example, in
[GitHub's New Issue page](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)
(instead of uploading them as a less comfortable option), to full-blown apps that make use of
several features such as file handling, file system access, and clipboard access, as in
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/). Where previously a platform-specific app was required, in
some cases now a web application can fill in. An example of such is [Wooting](https://wooting.io/)'s
[Wootility](https://wootility.io/) app for programming gaming keyboards with the
[WebHID API](https://web.dev/hid/).

Similarly, running [How Fugu is my browser?](https://howfuguismybrowser.dev/) on each new version of
your browser of choice is very satisfying, since with almost every new browser release, the progress
bar moves up a little and your browser has gained a new capability or two.

Building for the web is more viable than ever, and new features keep being added to the platform at
an amazing pace. The web is not your only choice for building your app, but I hope with this article
I have convinced you to give the [capable web](/blog/fugu-showcase/) a
second look if you have not considered it so far. It has come a long way.
